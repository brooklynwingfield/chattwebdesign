                <p>Steam is an application that allows creators to distribute their games for the public to download and play.</p>
                <p>Kyle Seeley published 'Emily is Away' onto Steam November 20, 2015. 'Emily is Away Too' was put onto Steam May 26, 2017. And, 'Emily is Away <3' was uploaded April 16, 2021.</p>

                <p>Itch.io was likely the beginner platform that Seeley used as it is easier process to upload games onto Itch.io than Steam.</p>
                <p>However, the games still remain at the same price as on Steam, and all three games in the series (as well as Seeley's other projects that aren't on Steam) are available for download on their Itch.io page.</p>
