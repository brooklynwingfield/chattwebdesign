                        <p>When starting up the 'Emily is Away' expreience, you are immediately thrown into an old Windows desktop view with that iconic startup sound. Then, after selecting your chapter, you get to pick your screename and first name that is utilized in your gameplay.</p>
                        <p>The game's AI will have the fictional in-game characters acknowledge you by your first name, while sometimes, usually during your first meeting, the AI will call you by your screenname.</p>

                <p>For example, since the first Saw movie was incredibly popular in its release date of 2004, one of the icon options for the 2004 chapter is the Saw logo.</p>
